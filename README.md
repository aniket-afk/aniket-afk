## üöÄ **About Me**  
As a Data Engineer with 2+ years of experience at leading organizations like Accenture, I am passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive efficiency and innovation. My work centers on designing scalable solutions, automating workflows, and simplifying complex processes‚Äîfrom migrating enterprise data systems to building AI-powered tools that empower users to navigate regulations seamlessly. Currently pursuing a Master‚Äôs in Information Systems at Northeastern University, I blend technical expertise with a user-first mindset to solve real-world challenges.

I pride myself on being a collaborative and approachable team player who thrives in cross-functional environments. Whether leading a team to ensure 99% data accuracy or crafting intuitive dashboards for stakeholders, I prioritize clarity, trust, and measurable impact. My ability to bridge technical and operational needs has enabled me to reduce manual workloads by 40%, accelerate decision-making, and deliver solutions that align with both business goals and user needs.
